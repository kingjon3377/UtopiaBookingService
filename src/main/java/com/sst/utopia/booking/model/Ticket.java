/**
 * A ticket, or seat (for which a ticket may be or may have been sold), on a
 * flight.
 *
 * Unlike most model classes, several fields in this class are expected to be
 * modified as tickets are booked (and cancelled, but that's out of the scope of
 * this service), and so have setters. Other fields are not expected to be
 * modified, and so do not have setters, but are left non-final for the JPA
 * persistence system. It's possible to get an instance of this class into an
 * invalid state using the provided setters; the isValid() method is provided to
 * check validity, and callers are expected to pass only valid objects to other
 * code. But some setters do some basic sanity checks.
